# Junit-Projects
This was a project I worked on in class for my testing course that focused on implementing Junit tests and webpage testing with selenium
The base facts project and thermostat project was provided but all test functions and test classes were programmed by me
PC CC and CACC testing was written by me for the thermostat package
